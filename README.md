# My First App in Kotlin using Android Studio

### Overview

This is my first ever app using Android Studio. I want this to be a precursor to another idea I had in mind in Mobile App Development. This app will be my playground and experimenting phase to design something that will hopefully be useful.

I am using a wide array of resources from Kotlin documentation and several tutorial from the Android Developer's Website. I want to make sure that I give credit to them here. After I get the hang of things I will make this a project of my own by continuing with what I am doing here and hopefully in another repository.

### Development Environment

* Kotlin
* Android Studio Arctic Fox | 2020.3.1 Patch 2

### Useful Websites

* [Android Tutorial Website](https://developer.android.com/training/basics)
